\section{Strategy}
The strategy used to obtain the best model was simply to do some quick, lost cost experiments to establish a baseline 
for accuracy. There were 4 models that were explored briefly at this stage of the project. The four models explored were a simple feed forward neural network, a convolutional neural network, a random forests classifier and a naive bayes classifier. 
The text preprocessing done was handled by spaCy \cite{spacy} alone. In addition to these 4 models, Facebook's FastText \cite{fasttext} program/library was used for text classification to quickly determine the best accuracy obtainable with their system. 
The accuracy scores for these simple models are listed below.

Please note that the simple feed forward neural network was not able to be trained due to a OOM exception, even when using a 8 node GPU cluster, it was clearly evident that the model 
needed to be simplified and this lead to convolutional neural networks being explored.
